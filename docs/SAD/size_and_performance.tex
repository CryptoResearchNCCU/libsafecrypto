\section{Size}

The size goals have been identified in Table \ref{table:size_goals}:

\caption{Size Goals and Solutions}
\label{table:size_goals}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l p{13cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Goal} &\textbf{Description}  \\
\midrule
\textbf{S1 Platform} &The target platform for initial deployment will be an Intel x86/AMD64 processor, with consideration for later deployment on other processors ranging from low level microcontrollers with no FPU up to high-end multi-core processors. \\
\midrule
\textbf{S2 Scalability} &The \textit{SAFEcrypto} library must be capable of scaling at compile-time to exploit the available hardware resources and capabilities made available by the C compiler on that target platform. It is envisaged that application specific variants of the library will be required at compile-time, such as high performance server and low power embedded variants. \\

\section{Performance}

The performance goals have been identified in Table \ref{table:performance_goals}:

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l p{13cm}}
\toprule
\textbf{Goal} &\textbf{Description}  \\
\midrule
\textbf{P1 Lattices} &The library must be equivalent to or exceed the performance of existing lattice-based cryptography implementations. \\
\midrule
\textbf{P2 Classical} &The library must provide cryptographic schemes that are competitive in terms of performance, memory usage and/or bandwidth requirements in comparison to classical public-key cryptography schemes \\
