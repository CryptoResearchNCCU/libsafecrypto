\label{ch_goals_and_constraints}

The SAFEcrypto software architecture has been designed with the following objectives in mind:

\begin{itemize}
\item Low overhead lattice-based cryptographic software implementations for embedded platforms.
  \begin{enumerate}[(a)]
  \item Low level cryptographic algorithms optimised for a small memory footprint.
  \item Optimisation of arithmetic intensize operations for high speed implementations.
  \end{enumerate}
\item High performance lattice-based cryptographic software implementations for multi-core architectures:
  \begin{enumerate}[(b)]
  \item A fully pipelined parallel architecture to maximise throughput.
  \item Optimisation of scheduling and resource allocation for high scalability.
  \end{enumerate}
\item Future hardware acceleration using FPGA/ASIC.
\end{itemize}

The major design and implementation constraints on the system are:

\begin{itemize}
\item Portability
\item Reliability
\item Security
\item Maintainability
\item Flexibility
\end{itemize}

The \textit{libsafecrypto} library must adhere to the security coding guideliness described in \cite{safecrypto_secure_coding_guidelines} and discussed in Chapter \ref{ch_security}.
