# SAFEcrypto

**S**ecure **A**rchitectures of **F**uture **E**merging **Cryptography**

SAFEcrypto will provide a new generation of practical, robust, and physically
secure post-quantum cryptographic functions. Work Package 6 will develop a
suite of software routines to implement the lattice-based constructions identified
in Work Package 4 of the SAFEcrypto project, whilst providing cryptographic
primitives for use in the demonstrations developed in Work Package 9.

The following schemes are currently supported...

Signatures:
- BLISS-B
- Dilithium / Dilithium-G
- ENS
- DLP
- Ring-TESLA
- Falcon (this branch only)
             
KEM:
- ENS
- Kyber
             
Encryption:
- RLWE
- Kyber
             
IBE:
- DLP

# Dependencies

autotools, autoconf, autoconf-archive, automake, libtool, doxygen, texlive,
pkg-config, check-devel, subunit-devel

Optionally: gmp, mpfr

Dockerfile available in master branch

# Installation

If building from a cloned version control repository (rather than a source
code distribution) the user must configure autotools by running the 
following script:

    ./autogen.sh

Generate the required Makefile's for your environment using the folowing
command:

    ./configure

If the library and associated software is to be created for development purposes
or debugging then the configure command should be passed the relevant arguments:

    ./configure CPPFLAGS=-DDEBUG CFLAGS="-g -O0"

The generated Makefile at the root level must then be executed to build the
SAFEcrypto software library and all associated applications. A number of
automated tests are executed as part of the automated build to ensure that the
software has been successfuly built on the target system.

    make

If the user wishes to generate the reference documentation in PDF and html
format then the following make target should be executed:

    make doxygen-doc

In order to install the generated libraries onto the system the user must
execute the following command:

    make install


---
# Running Tests

The source code for the test functions can be found in ./test/functional. Different variants of the schemes are included, e.g. func_alg_dlp_sig.c refers to the DLP signature scheme, whilst func_alg_dlp_sig_recovery.c refers to the variant with the message recovery property. Test files for components such as sampling and NTT are also present. To run the FALCON signature scheme:

    ./func_alg_function

Within the test files, parameter sets can be modified (specified by the i index) and flags can be set to specify sampling techniques used or countermeasures switched on. The list of available flags is found in include/safecrypto.h.
